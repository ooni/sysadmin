# XXX This currently fails on the run.ooni.io machine due to error code 137
# after a bit of research it seems like this is a sign of node running out of
# memory:
# * https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/4008
# * https://github.com/kasperisager/vanilla-bootstrap/issues/164
# I tried a couple of mentioned workarounds to reduce memory usage (node
# --max-old-space-size), but they don't seem to work.
# For the moment I have solved it by just uploading the built `.next` directory
# manually, but we should move this to a beafier box in the future
